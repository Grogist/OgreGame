Overview:
  OgreGame is a real time strategy(ish) game in which you have no control of your units. The AI controls how each unit behaves and where it goes.
  The object is be the first to get 750 points.
  You are on team C1.
  The map consists of two different types of capture locations. Green, which give resources; and Blue, which give points. Red locations act as a base and spawn units.
  The AI will decide what locations to capture and what locations to reinforce.
  You have the option to influence the AI's decisions by selecting a square and changing it's priority. The higher the number the more likely the AI will send units to that location, the lower the number the less likely.
